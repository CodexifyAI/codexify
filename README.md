Codexify is a platform that offers state-of-the-art PII detection, masking, and synthetic-data-insertion capabilities for structured data.  With the rise of third party generative AI products, it is more important than ever that companies are able to securely identify, mask, and/or swap-out sensitive information.  

Codexify currently exists in a few incarnations:
- API (Offline): download a Docker image and host Codexify on-premise - perfect for users that have rigorous data storage requirements (looking at you, EU ;) )
- API (Web): access our API [here](link)
- SaaS: Our API can also be accessible through a user-friendly interface [here](https://codexify.ai)
